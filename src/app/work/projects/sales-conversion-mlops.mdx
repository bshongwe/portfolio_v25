# 🚀 Sales Conversion MLOps
This project focuses on enhancing sales conversion rates through meticulous
data handling and efficient model training. The goal is to optimize conversions
using a structured pipeline and predictive modeling.

## Overview
This project was structured to streamline the process from data ingestion and
cleaning to model training and evaluation. With an aim to empower efficient
decision-making, our pipelines incorporate quality validation tests, drift
analysis, and rigorous model performance evaluations.

It aims to streamline your sales conversion process, providing insights and
predictions to drive impactful business decisions using ZenML Integration and
Neptune Integration.

# Train Pipeline 🚂

The pipeline comprises the following:

- **run_pipeline.py**: Initiates the training pipeline.
- **steps/ingest_Data**: Ingests the data, sending it to the data_validation step.
- **data_validation step**: Conducts validation tests and transforms values.
- **steps/clean_Data**: Carries out data preprocessing logics.
- **data_Drift_validation step**: Conducts data drift tests.
- **steps/train_model.py**: Utilizes h2o.ai AUTOML for model selection.
- **src/train_models.py**: Implements the best model on the cleaned dataset.
- **model_performance_Evaluation.py**: Assesses model performance on a split dataset.
- **steps/alert_report.py**: If any of validation test suites doesn't meet threshold condition, email will be sent to the user, along with the failed Evidently.AI generated HTML reports.

Each step is crucial in refining and validating our model. All aboard the train pipeline! 🌟🚆

# Continuous Integration Pipeline ⚙️

The continuous integration pipeline focuses on the production environment and
streamlined processes for deployment 🔄:

- **ci-cd.py**: Triggered to initiate the CI/CD pipeline.
- **steps/production_batch_data**: Accesses production batch data from the Production_data folder
- **pipelines/ci_cd_pipeline.py**: As we already discussed earlier, we conduct Data Quality, Data Drift as previously we did, if threshold fails, email reports are sent.
- **steps/predict_production_Data.py**: Utilizes the pre-trained best model to make predictions on new production data. Then, we conduct Model Performance validation as previously we did, if threshold fails, email reports are sent.

This pipeline is crucial for maintaining a continuous and reliable deployment
process. 🔁✨

## Alert Reports 📧

Email reports are a vital part of the pipeline to notify users when certain
tests fail. These reports are triggered by specific conditions during the
pipeline execution. Here's how it works:

### E-mail Details

Upon data quality or data drift test or model performance validation tests
failures, an email is generated detailing:

- Number of total tests performed.
- Number of passed and failed tests.
- Failed test reports attached in HTML format.

# Prediction App 🚀
