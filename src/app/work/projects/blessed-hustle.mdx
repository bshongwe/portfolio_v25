# Blessed Hustle eShop

**Blessed Hustle** is an e-commerce platform designed to connect with small
businesses, entrepreneurs and clients in Southern Africa by providing a
seamless online shopping experience. It integrates multiple payment gateways to
support local and international transactions, with a focus on scalability,
security and reliability.

---

## Project Overview

Blessed Hustle consists of two main components:
- **Frontend**: A React-based static site built with Create React App, offering a user-friendly shopping cart interface.
- **Backend**: A Node.js Express server with ES Modules, handling payment processing, transaction tracking, and API services.

The platform targets Southern African markets (e.g., South Africa, Botswana,
Zimbabwe) but is designed to scale across Africa, with deployment optimized for
low-latency regions like `europe-west1` on GCP.

## Key Features

### Frontend
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and manage items with real-time total calculations (subtotal, discount, total).
- **Payment Selection**: Choose from multiple payment methods directly in the UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and styled for mobile and desktop users.

### Backend
- **Payment Gateway Integration**:
  - **MTN MoMo**: Mobile money payments for Southern Africa.
  - **PayShap**: Instant EFT via South African banks (Capitec, FNB, Standard Bank, Investec, Nedbank, Absa).
  - **PayPal**: International card and PayPal account payments.
  - **iKhokha**: Local card and EFT payments.
  - **Paystack**: Pan-African payment solution for cards and mobile money.
  - **Yoco**: South African online payment processing.
- **Transaction Tracking**:
  - **Redis**: Caches transaction status (pending, completed, failed) for fast lookups.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Persistently stores transaction details (ID, method, amount, status, etc.).
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate transactions using unique keys.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse with a 100-requests-per-15-minutes limit.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Retries Redis/PostgreSQL connections, logs errors with Winston.

### Deployment
- **GCP Cloud Run**: Hosts both frontend (static) and backend (server) with auto-scaling.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions deploys to GCP, with testing, health checks, and rollback on failure.
