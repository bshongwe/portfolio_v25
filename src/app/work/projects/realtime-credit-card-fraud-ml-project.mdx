## ðŸš€ Real-time Credit Card Fraud Detection

Real-time Credit Card Fraud Detection is an end-2-end example of a real time ML
system to predict credit card fraud, focusing on

- crypto price prediction
- click-through rate prediction
- anomaly detection, or
- a problem that needs the ML models to quickly adapt to changing patterns

## Key Features

The system is modular, so different feature engineering logic and models can be
applied for the same incoming data. This way their internal Data Science teams
can do things like:

- Experiment with different feature engineering logic
- Experiment with different model architectures
- Compare the performance of different models, for safe deployments.
- Monitor the model performance over time
- Retrain the model incrementally on new data, to quickly adapt to changing fraud patterns.
