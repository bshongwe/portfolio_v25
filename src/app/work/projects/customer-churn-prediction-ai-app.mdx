## Overview

A machine learning project for predicting customer churn using ML techniques to
predict which customers are likely to stop using a service. The solution
analyzes various customer behavioral and demographic data points—such as age,
account balance and activity history—to identify patterns associated with
churn. By training multiple models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM,
the project selects the best-performing model for deployment. The final model
is deployed through an interactive web app, providing real-time predictions and
actionable insights. In addition to predictions, the app offers personalized
explanations of the factors driving each customer’s risk of churning.
Businesses can use these insights to implement targeted retention strategies,
boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty through automated engagement, such
as personalized email campaigns.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Visualize data distributions and analyze correlations to gain insights.
- **Model Training**: Train 5 different machine learning models for churn prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search to optimize the models.
- **Web App Deployment**: Serve the best-performing model through a web application for real-time predictions.
- **Churn Explanation**: Provide feature importance insights and personalized recommendations.
- **Email Generation**: Generate engaging emails to encourage at-risk customers to stay.

## Technologies Used

- **Python, Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn & XGBoost**: Tools for machine learning and model building.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Visualization libraries for EDA.
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the web app and interacting with predictions.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating explanations and personalized customer emails.
- **Groq API**: For interacting with models via Groq's accelerated AI API services.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For iterative development and experimentation.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading trained machine learning models.

## Results

The Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier achieved the highest
accuracies, with XGBoost also providing better precision for churn cases.
Ultimately, the XGBoost model was selected for deployment due to its balance of
accuracy and interpretability


## Outcome

The models' accuracy recorded an increased of 95%.
