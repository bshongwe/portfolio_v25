## Overview

Welcome to Nestec! Nestec is an innovative agriculture app designed to
streamline farm management tasks and optimize agricultural operations. Whether
you are a small-scale farmer or managing a large farm, Nestec offers tools to
enhance productivity and efficiency. Nestec is a full stack agriculture app. It
provides the user, oftenly, a farmer, with a digitalised farm management
platform from the comfort of the preferred device; for web use, a dektop or
laptop, whilst, for mobile and hand-held devices, making use of our app
available on mobile store platforms.

## Product Slogan

<i> "...Empowering farmers, one harvest at a time..." </i>

## Key Features

- **Inventory**: nventory module helps farmers manage the farm's labour, equipment, livestock and farm activities. The app utilises a database that stores each labourer's information, farm equipment details, as well as scheduled farm activities.
- **Data Ingestion**: Downloads the dataset from a secure location and extracts it for further processing.
- **Data Validation**: Validates data against a schema to ensure integrity and correctness.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies necessary transformations (encoding, scaling) to prepare data for training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest model using both dummy and real data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test set.
- **Deploy**: Builds and pushes a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry, then deploys via SSH.

## Technologies Used

- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking.
- **Flask**: For the ML app's API, triggers training on deployment through endpoint.
- **DVC**: For data versioning.
- **Docker**: For ochestration/ containerisation.
- **Streamlit**: For the ML app's interactive UI.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/ CD automation via the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was getting the pipeline's check points to pass (all green checks). Debugging the deployed model became easier once this was handled.

## Outcome

The model's accuracy gradually increased, by atleast 15% from first deployment as of 14 February 2025.
