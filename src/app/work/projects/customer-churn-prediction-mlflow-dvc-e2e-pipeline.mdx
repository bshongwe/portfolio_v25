## Overview

An end-to-end machine learning project for predicting customer churn, leveraging MLflow for experiment tracking, DVC for data versioning, and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline. This project follows a modular approach, covering data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation and deployment.

## Key Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: This project leverages GitHub Actions for an automated, end-to-end ML workflow, ensuring efficient and reliable execution of each stage.
- **Data Ingestion**: Downloads the dataset from a secure location and extracts it for further processing.
- **Data Validation**: Validates data against a schema to ensure integrity and correctness.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies necessary transformations (encoding, scaling) to prepare data for training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest model using both dummy and real data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test set.
- **Deploy**: Builds and pushes a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry, then deploys via SSH.

## Technologies Used

- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking.
- **Flask**: For the ML app's API, triggers training on deployment through endpoint.
- **DVC**: For data versioning.
- **Docker**: For ochestration/ containerisation.
- **Streamlit**: For the ML app's interactive UI.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/ CD automation via the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was getting the pipeline's check points to pass (all green checks). Debugging the deployed model became easier once this was handled.

## Outcome

The model's accuracy gradually increased, by atleast 15% from first deployment as of 14 February 2025.
