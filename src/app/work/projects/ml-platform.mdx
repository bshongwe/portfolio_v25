## ðŸš€ ML Platform Workshop  

The **ML Platform Workshop** is an ML platform, designed to help data science
teams set up essential infrastructure for deploying machine learning models. It
provides:  

- A **model template** (using Cookiecutter) to streamline new project setups for data scientists.  
- **Infrastructure code** (using Pulumi) to provision essential ML tools like Kubernetes, MLFlow, and more.  

### Motivation

As ML models transition from experimentation to production, robust, scalable
and maintainable infrastructure becomes critical. Leading tech companiesâ€”Uber,
Netflix, and Airbnbâ€”have pioneered ML platform solutions to streamline
deployment, monitoring, and governance. This workshop serves as a practical
starting point for engineering teams looking to build a similar ecosystem.
As machine learning models move into production, robust infrastructure becomes
crucial. Inspired by industry leaders like Uber, Netflix, and Airbnb, this
workshop provides a starting point for building your own ML platform.

### Core Technologies

The project leverages the following tools to handle model serving, experiment
tracking, data versioning, CI/CD and API management integrating a modern MLOps
stack:

- **FastAPI**: High-performance model serving  
- **MLFlow**: Experiment tracking and model registry  
- **DVC**: Data versioning and pipeline reproducibility  
- **Cookiecutter**: Standardized model template generation  
- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure provisioning as code  
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation  
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy and API gateway  
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management:

### Future Enhancements  

This project lays the groundwork for an ML platform but is intentionally
minimalistic. Areas for expansion include:  

- Secure **authentication** and HTTPS configuration  
- Multi-environment support (staging, production)  
- Standardized preprocessing and postprocessing libraries  
- Model input validation and inference pipelines  
- Automated training orchestration
